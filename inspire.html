		<p>Lionel Messi has inspired me in various ways. It is always inspiring to see Messi prove his doubters wrong. For his whole career they mocked him for only being a club player.</p> 
    <p>Four years ago he won his first ever international trophy. A couple years later he was able to win the biggest international trophy, the World Cup.</p>
